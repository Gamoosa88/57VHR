The previous AI engineer successfully initiated development of a prototype HR application for 1957 Ventures. The work commenced with a clear understanding of product requirements, including core functionalities like HR Dashboard, HR Services, Policy Center, and an AI Chat Assistant, along with the need to parse and apply a detailed HR policy document. The AI engineer adopted a phased approach, prioritizing a frontend-only implementation with mock data to demonstrate functionality quickly. This phase was successfully completed, showcasing a fully interactive UI. Subsequently, the engineer began backend integration, creating models, API endpoints, and connecting the OpenAI assistant. The immediate last step involved debugging a  in the backend, which was identified and fixed, indicating readiness for further testing and development.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a prototype HR application for 1957 Ventures, offering a seamless, AI-assisted experience for HR services. The application needs a user-friendly UI, policy-aware logic, automated workflows, and an AI-powered HR assistant/chat. A functioning demo of all journeys is required, without needing a full backend initially.

Core functionalities include:
*   **Authentication & Profile Setup:** Simulated signup via company email, input of basic employee info. (User chose to demo this without full integration).
*   **HR Dashboard:** Summary cards for vacation days, pending requests, last salary, business trip status, and navigation to main services.
*   **HR Services:** Forms for Vacation Leave, Sick Leave, Work from Home, Salary Certificate, Expense Reimbursement, Business Trip, simulating full form submission and confirmation.
*   **Policy Center:** Searchable UI to browse categorized policies (Leaves, Compensation, Travel, Conduct), with full-text search.
*   **AI Chat Assistant:** Must understand commands (How many vacation days do I have?, Request a sick leave, Show me the expense policy, Give me my last business trip details), execute form submissions based on chat, and answer HR-related questions using the provided HR policy text. (User selected OpenAI for this).
*   **HR Policy Document:** The provided HR policy document is critical for powering vacation day calculations, deciding eligibility for requests, answering AI chat questions, and validating fields.
*   **Testing:** Simulate and test all user flows, confirm AI assistant reads policy correctly, validate navigation, and ensure clear confirmation states.

<pending_tasks>
- Full authentication integration (user explicitly opted for demo only).
- Complete the backend logic for all HR Services requests (form processing, policy validation).
- Refine AI Chat Assistant's policy-aware responses based on actual policy parsing logic in the backend.
- Comprehensive end-to-end testing of all modules with the integrated backend.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Currently, the application is in the process of integrating the frontend with the newly developed FastAPI backend. All core frontend modules (Dashboard, HR Services, Policy Center, AI Chat Assistant) have been developed with mock data and then updated to interact with the backend APIs. The backend includes MongoDB models for users, requests, policies, and chat history, and is set up for OpenAI integration for the AI assistant.

The most recent work involved resolving a  in the backend's  file, which prevented the server from starting correctly. This issue, , was identified by inspecting the supervisor logs and subsequently fixed by adjusting the import path in . The backend server is now reported as  after the fix. The frontend is configured to use the real backend URL, and the AI Chat Assistant is attempting to communicate with the real OpenAI API through the backend.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
I will re-run the backend tests to confirm the fix for the  import error and then proceed with end-to-end frontend testing.
